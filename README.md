## Guix OS and clone() System Call - Simple Guide

Guix System is a special kind of Linux that lets you manage your computer in a clear and organized way.

Start your computer using the USB and follow the steps on the screen.  
Set up your user account and basic tools to get started.  
After finishing, restart your computer and run a quick update.

### b. Using clone() System Call

The clone() function lets a program make a copy of itself to do more than one thing at a time.  
On Guix OS, you can use it by writing a small C program.  
It needs a little setup, like giving it space to run the new copy.  
You then build the program and run it in the terminal.  
You can check if it worked by looking at the list of running programs.
